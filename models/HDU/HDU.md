The Habitation Systems Project is a unique project from a multi-center team of NASA architects, scientists and engineers, working together to develop sustainable living quarters,
workspaces, and laboratories for next-generation space missions.
The Habitation Systems Project's Deep Space Habitat (DSH) is a one story, 4-port habitat unit with an approximate volume of 56 cubic meters [1,978 ft3].
The HDU-DSH shell can accommodate an inflatable loft for additional laboratory or habitation volume.
